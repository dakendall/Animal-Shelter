# Animal-Shelter
You work for Global Rain, a software engineering company that specializes in custom software design and development. Your team has been assigned to work on a project for an innovative international rescue-animal training company, Grazioso Salvare. You have been made the lead developer on this project.

As part of its work, Grazioso Salvare identifies dogs that are good candidates for search-and-rescue training. When trained, these dogs are able to find and help to rescue humans or other animals, often in life-threatening conditions. To help identify dogs for training, Grazioso Salvare has reached an agreement with a non-profit agency that operates five animal shelters in the region around Austin, Texas. This non-profit agency will provide Grazioso Salvare with data from their shelters.

In meeting with the client, you have discovered that they look for certain profiles in dogs to train. For example, search-and-rescue training is generally more effective for dogs that are no more than two years old. Additionally, different breeds of dogs are proficient at different types of rescue, such as water rescue, mountain or wilderness rescue, locating humans after a disaster, or finding a specific human by tracking their scent.

Grazioso Salvare is seeking a software application that can work with existing data from the animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. Global Rain has contracted for a full stack development of this application, including a database and a client-facing web application dashboard through which users at Grazioso Salvare will access the database.
